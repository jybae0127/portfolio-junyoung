            I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and studying Business at the University of Hong Kong. My journey in the world of coding has been an exciting one, driving me to become proficient in both front-end and back-end development.

            Beyond coding, I find solace in jogging and cinema. Jogging offers me relaxation and a way to clear my mind, while movies ignite my creativity and broaden my worldview.
